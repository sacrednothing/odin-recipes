        <p>10 ingredient, 30 minute vegan mac n cheese infused with green chili and topped with crispy baked crushed tortilla chips!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces large macaroni shells</li>
            <li>1/2 medium white onion</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 cup raw cashews (soaked for 4-6 hours or overnight, then drained)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1 4-ounce can diced chiles (scoop half into sauce, reserve half for finished mac)</li>
            <li>1 cup tortilla chips (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro (optional/for topping)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If topping with tortilla chips, crush chips into fine crumbs and add to a baking pan lined with parchment paper or foil. 
                Spritz with olive or avocado oil, sprinkle with salt and stir. Then bake in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 10 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Boil macaroni according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, sauté onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, 
                stir and cook until soft and fragrant – about 7 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onions and garlic to a blender with remaining ingredients, omitting the tortilla chips and adding only half of the green chilies. 
                Blend until smooth, using the “liquify” setting if you have it to get it really smooth. Otherwise just blend for up to a minute, 
                scraping down sides as necessary, until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Drain the noodles, set aside, and cover (with a towel). To the same pot you boiled the noodles in, add the cashew cheese and cook on low, 
                stirring frequently until slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>Add the macaroni noodles to the cheese, along with the remaining green chilies and stir. Serve immediately, 
                topping with crushed toasted tortilla chips and cilantro (optional).</li>
        </ol>
